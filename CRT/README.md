# Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) Encryption and Decryption

This Python script demonstrates file encryption and decryption using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) based on prime numbers.

## Usage

1. Run the `encrypt()` function to encrypt a file named "file.txt" and generate the encrypted file "out.txt".
2. Run the `decrypt()` function to decrypt the "out.txt" file and create the final decrypted file "final.txt".

## Key Generation

The script generates a list of prime numbers to form the basis of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

## File Structure

- `file.txt`: Input file for encryption.
- `out.txt`: Encrypted file.
- `final.txt`: Decrypted final output.
